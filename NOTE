This is a placeholder redirect index.html for the old netlify DP site. I want to keep the site and the site name for future use, though. So I'll leave this here. The problem was that Google did index this site (which I told it not to do), so that it started appearing in search results and cannibalising traffic from the main site. Now it's down and all the content is in main.
